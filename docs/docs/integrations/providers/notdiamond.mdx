# Not Diamond

[Not Diamond](https://notdiamond.ai) offers an AI-powered model router that automatically determines which LLM is best suited to respond to any query,
improving LLM output quality by combining multiple LLMs into a **meta-model** that learns when to call each LLM.

Not Diamond supports cost and latency tradeoffs, customized router training, and real-time router personalization. Learn more via [the documentation](https://notdiamond.readme.io/).

## Installation

```shell
pip install langchain notdiamond
```

## Configuration

- API keys: You need API keys from [Not Diamond](https://app.notdiamond.ai/keys) and any LLM you want to use.

## Quick Start

Not Diamond offers `NotDiamondRoutedRunnable`, allowing you to include routing within your chain.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities.notdiamond import NotDiamondRoutedRunnable

from notdiamond import NotDiamond, LLMConfig

nd_client = NotDiamond(
    llm_configs=[LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-4o"), LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-4o-mini")],
    api_key=os.getenv("NOTDIAMOND_API_KEY"),
    default=LLMConfig("openai", "gpt-3.5-turbo"),
)

nd_runnable = NotDiamondRoutedRunnable(nd_client=nd_client)
# or: chain = nd_runnable | other_runnable | third_runnable

nd_runnable.invoke("Hello there! Not Diamond sent me to you. Which OpenAI model are you?")
```

```
